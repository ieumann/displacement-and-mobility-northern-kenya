## Analysing and Evaluating Mobility in Northern Kenya

The project's aim is to identify the key factors influencing mobility in the North of Kenya. And specifically observe the role droughts play in the region. Without a specific target, the analysis is done by applying unsupervised learning.

**BACKGROUND:** The ASAL region of Kenya has endured three severe droughts in the last decade (2010-2011, 2016-2017 and 2020-2022). The most recent drought (2020 - 2022) has also been the most severe and longest with widespread livelihood losses and massive displacement of populations.

The dataset is based on in-situ surveys carried out in five counties in Northern Kenya in November 2022 organized by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In order to combine the datasets, I previously standardized in Excel the questions across the five surveys. Additionally, I deleted (majorily) empty columns, columns that don't exist across all five datasets, and columns with identical/highly similar information. I also divided columns with more than one data point per cell in the respective amount of individual cells.
